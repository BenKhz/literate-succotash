# React Hooks Playground
Blank Canvas for Working with React to Learn Hooks

## A simple local server setup with all the configs and dependencies needed!
That way you can jump straight into learning without dealing with setting up a dev environment!

To use,
* ```npm i``` -> installs depends from npm
* ```npm run build``` --> builds webpack bundle
* ```npm start``` --> starts your server at port 3000.

Comes with the bare-bones.
* express
* react
* react-dom
* eslint (AirBnB code style)
* webpack with configs for babel loaders and react presets

Feel free to start smashing keys in the client/src/App.jsx! Changes should be rendered to the served index.html.

# Better
# Faster

Happy learning.
